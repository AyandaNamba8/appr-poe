The Disaster Alleviation Foundation 
, a non‐profit organisation, has approached you to build a
system for them. The foundation’s mission is to provide practical aid during disasters. They
receive donations from various sources and need a system to track what is available and what has
been dispatched to help with which disaster.

Donations can be made by individuals, companies, other organisations, and even governments.
Donations can be goods (clothes, non‐perishable foods, etc.) or monetary. Donors can choose to
remain anonymous.

The Disaster Alleviation Foundation then needs to track what happens with the donations. For
example, goods can be dispatched to help with a disaster. And money can either be paid out (for
example, to a local community organisation) or used to purchase goods that are then dispatched
to a disaster area.

The Disaster Alleviation Foundation has transparency as one of its core values. It is important to
them that the collected data is accurate and always available to the right stakeholders. That is
why they want a web application with some pages visible to everyone, with summarised
information, and other pages accessible only to their employees (for editing data).
